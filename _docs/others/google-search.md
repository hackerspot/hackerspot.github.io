# Google Search Operators

Search operator are special commands used in the search engine to list more specific results.

You can use this operator to find webpages with specific words in the URL.
With the below search on Google, you would find pages on amazom.com in which the URL contains the word “print.”

```

```

This search query would be helpful for finding pdf files in the directory or folder named “print” on the tesla.com website.

The query [ inurl:tesla cars ] will return results that mention the words “tesla” in the URL and “cars” anywhere in the document.

## inurl
